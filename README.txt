1) SimulationV3B.R --> 
	DGP: Three part incidental truncation dependence between access, selection and outcome equations with diferent regressors in the three stages, although same regressors for each variable within each stage
	Estimation as DGP
2) SimulationV2C.R -->
	DGP: Three part incidental truncation dependence between access, selection and outcome equations with diferent regressors in the three stages, although same regressors for each variable within each stage
	Estimation: Asume access is independent of selection and outcome equations
3) SimulationV3C.R -->
	DGP: Three part incidental truncation dependence between access, selection and outcome equations with regressor in access equal to W, and regressors in selections and outcomes W and z1
	Estimation as DGP
4) SimulationV1B.R -->
	Univariate setting
	DGP: Three part incidental truncation dependence between access, selection and outcome equations with diferent regressors in the three stages
	Estimation as DGP
5) SimulationV1C.R -->
	DGP: Three part incidental truncation dependence between access, selection and outcome equations with diferent regressors in the three stages, although same regressors for each variable within each stage
	Estimation in an univariate setting
